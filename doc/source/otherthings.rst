Other scripts you can run
=========================

Use :doc:`code/ds2csv` to get CSV data out of the stored datasets.

Use :doc:`code/exploreDataset` as a skeleton for your own experimentations with a given dataset, or to try out NumPy functions on realistic values.

Use :doc:`code/renewTimestamps` if you made modifications to a *sim-file* but don't want to run all the simulations generated by that sim-file again (because they didn't become invalid). For example when you had ``"q" : [0.2, 0.4]`` and you just added the value ``0.6``.

Use :doc:`code/runSingleSim` if you want to just run all the simulations generated by *just one specific sim-file* and bypass the timestamp checks.
