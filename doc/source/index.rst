Welcome to mcc's documentation!
===============================

:abbr:`mcc (migrating cancer cells)` is an arbitrary name for some code that lets you run simulations implementing a particular model of migrating cancer cells. What you are looking at is the documentation for that code. It is intended to help you:

* get an overview over what there is,
* get started setting up simulations, running them and analyzing the results, and
* understand what the code does and how you can modify it to your liking.
