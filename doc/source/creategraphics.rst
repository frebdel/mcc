Visualize trajectories and movement
===================================

The script ``graphics.py`` creates

* a plot of the trajectories taken by the agent
* a video of the agents navigating the maze.

To run it, make sure that the correct simulation is specified in the variable `currentsim` in the file ``mcclib/constants.py``, and then run

>>> python graphics.py

If you want just one of those outputs, you can simply put a comment sign in the relevant line in ``graphics.py``.
